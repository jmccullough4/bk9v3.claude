## Development Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Keep it simple** - Avoid over-engineering; implement only what's needed
2. **Read before editing** - Always read existing files before making changes
3. **Commit incrementally** - Make small, focused commits with clear messages
4. **No unnecessary files** - Don't create files unless absolutely required

### Git Workflow

- Create feature branches for new work
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain "why" not just "what"
- Push to remote branches with `-u` flag: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

### Code Style

When code is added to this repository:
- Follow consistent formatting within each file type
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only where logic isn't self-evident
- Avoid adding unused code, imports, or dependencies
